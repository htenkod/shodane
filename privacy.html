        <p class="policy-text">Our apps may be used by children under 13 with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian. Where required by law, we take additional steps to protect children’s privacy.</p>
        <ul class="policy-list">
            <li>We seek parental consent before collecting personal information from a child, or design the app so that it does not collect personal information from the child directly.</li>
            <li>Any contact information collected (such as a parent email) is used only to provide app services, respond to inquiries, or manage account settings.</li>
            <li>We do not use children’s personal information for targeted advertising or sell children’s personal information.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="policy-text">Parents can review, update, or delete their child’s information at any time by contacting us (see “Contact Us” below).</p>

        <h2 class="policy-section-title">6. Data Security and Retention</h2>

        <p class="policy-text">We retain information only for as long as needed to provide app services, comply with legal obligations, or resolve disputes. For children’s accounts, data is deleted or anonymized when it is no longer needed or upon verified parental request.</p>

        <h2 class="policy-section-title">7. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

            <li>Users can manage certain permissions (such as location or camera) through device settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="policy-section-title">8. International Transfers</h2>
